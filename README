Your seed node should have port 20202 publicly
accessible. It may be pinged from time-to-time
to determine its validity and reliability.

To add to the list of seed nodes on the network,
simply add your node to 'seed.csv'.

The file has two columns; 'type' and 'value'.

'type'; is one of 'ipv4', 'ipv6' or 'domain',
  where 'domain' is resolved in the DNS.

'value'; is the respective address of the node
  you're trying to add.

For example:

ipv4,127.0.0.1
ipv6,::1
domain,localhost
